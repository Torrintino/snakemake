    input: data/input.txt
    output: results/chunk_aa, results/chunk_ab

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 7 of /home/weislenn/snakemake/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/chunk_aa
results/chunk_ab
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 4 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 4
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
